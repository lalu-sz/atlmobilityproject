# Lesson 07: Final project beta map and presentation

## Overview

This module's objective is to build a "beta" final project that you will share with colleagues in class. A beta version should include all of the desired features and be ready for testing. A short screen-capture video will accompany the beta map to demonstrate its functionality and the desired user experience. The video presentation should discuss your challenges, successes, and the future direction of the project.

## Introduction

We're actively developing final map projects and aim to have functional prototypes working by the end of this week. This means:

- Data are collected/processed/formatted/optimized/simplified with a clear plan for how they will be used.
- Data are loading (from a local resource or API) and available for use in the map.
- Data are being symbolized in the appropriate thematic way (choropleth, proportional symbols, etc)
- Interaction elements (e.g., modals, popups, etc.) are being developed, tested, working (or kinda broken).
- Basic page layout and UI elements are prototyped (e.g., headers, menus, sidebars, info windows).

## Part I: Beta map (10 pts)

During this week, you will focus on making a beta version of your map project. To prototype faster, you may use any of the templates used in previous modules or create a new one. During the last week, we will focus on refining the map, customizing its design, and adding desired features.

When you are ready to share your beta map:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your map project **on your GitHub account** and work within that repo. Give the repo a short, descriptive name related to your map, which will also form the URL for your project, e.g., `github.com/username/repo-name`. It will be the repository where you will store all of your code and assets for the project.

2. Include a README.md file at the root level of the repository and add the contents of your proposal that you developed in the previous module.

3. Make the repository public (so people can see/share your awesome code), and add the instructor as a collaborator for pull requests.

4. [Enable GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) for the repository.

5. Add a link in the README.md file to the live map on GitHub Pages, i.e., `https://username.github.io/repo-name`.

### Deliverable

Share the URL to your GitHub repository (the `.com` URL) in the Canvas Submission page. If you want feedback or collaboration on your code, please comment the area of concern in your code.

## Part II: Discuss Beta map (2.5 pts)

Post the URL to your GitHub Pages Beta map (the `.io` URL) to the module's discuss forum. With the post, include a 5-minute screen recording of your map for sharing with your instructor and colleagues. There are many free/open source screen-casting video software options, e.g., [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) or [Jing](https://www.techsmith.com/jing-tool.html).

The presentation should cover the following:

- Minute 1: Introduce your topic and your motivation for the project.
- Minute 2: Briefly describe your target user, their goals and objectives for using the map.
- Minutes 3 - 4: Walk us through a live use case scenario using the map. Explain the various interface components and how the user will use them.
- Minute 5: Conclude with any features, functionality, or design aspects you'd like to attend to or improve upon for the final week (a "wish list").

### Deliverable

Share the URL to your GitHub Pages (the `.io` URL) in the Canvas discussion forum and attach the video to the post.
